# RCOA_HabitatAssociations

Species – habitat tabular dataset: This product will contain information derived from an intersection of species Source Feature (SF) data with a digital habitat map provided by NALCC. The digital habitat map was developed by Mark Anderson and Charles Ferree of TNC based on NatureServe’s Ecological System classification, and has been further updated for this project. The resulting product will be a non-spatial table with a row corresponding to each SF, and columns to include: NatureServe record IDs, scientific name, common name, conservation status (G-rank, S-rank), last observed year, state, watersheds, ecoregions, and the habitat classes. This dataset will allow NALCC to create a list of species by habitat, but will not allow them to pinpoint the location of a species at a particular site.
